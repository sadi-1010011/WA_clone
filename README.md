# WhatsApp clone using React.

This project was developed for educational purposes only.


If anyone interested in this project to continue / complete this app, for collaboration kindly contact me anytime..

I wish if it was the case we could implement both back-end and database to make it perfect clone. And also I hope we can implement the extra / beta features before hand someday.. 

Any feedback or comments are most welcome

You can find my personal info in my bio and contact me anytime. I will be there, most probably :)
